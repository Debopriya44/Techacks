# Detector_Techacks

There are type of diseases which can be managed with combination of lifestyle changes, medicine & in very rare cases surgery.With right prediction this disease type can be reduced by taking proper action and the functioning of the body can be improved, this will help to prevent any high cost surgical treatment and other expenses.

In this project I had implemented two machine learning models which will predict the chances of the heart attack and diabetes on the parameters of the patients given as a input.
